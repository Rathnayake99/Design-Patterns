# Design-Patterns

Design patterns are commonly used solutions to recurring problems that software developers encounter during the software development process. Design patterns are documented solutions to common problems in software design that have been tested and proven over time.

They provide a common vocabulary and framework for developers to communicate and collaborate effectively while designing and developing software. Design patterns can help developers to build more robust, efficient, and maintainable software systems.

There are several categories of design patterns, including ***creational*** patterns, ***structural*** patterns, and ***behavioral*** patterns. Examples of commonly used design patterns include the Singleton pattern, Factory pattern, Observer pattern, Decorator pattern, and Strategy pattern. Each pattern provides a specific solution to a particular type of problem, and developers can choose the appropriate pattern based on the problem they are trying to solve.
